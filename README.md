# wundermeeting-demo

Repo for downloading the Wundermeeting demo, in-development app.

## Soonami Hackathon
**For soonami team**: if you need access to the source code (macOS and backend), please contact me in Discord (ustefano) or email (ustefano@gmail.com) and I'll grant you access.

Short intro: implementation of this Proof of Concept started the second day of the hackathon. It is a native macOS app and a node.js backend connected to openAI API.

### Version submitted to the hackathon:
**requirements: macOS 14.4 and newer , M1 and newer**
The app is still raw, therefore here are the steps: 
- select from the list the meeting app you want to use (it can be any app, for example you can simulate a call with the chatGPT app)
- **click on both buttons *Start* and *Unmute***
- take notes if you want to
- click on Stop when you are done
- wait about 10 seconds for the results

Version submitted: **0.1** (download the repository as a zip and you can just click on the app)
